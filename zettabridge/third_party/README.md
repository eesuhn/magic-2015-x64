### dynarmic-0001-thumb32-armv8.patch

Adds ARMv8 AArch32 T32 instructions that the A32 decoder already had.

1. The "load acquire" / "store release" family:
`LDAB`, `LDAH`, `LDAEX`, `LDAEXB`, `LDAEXH`, `LDAEXD`, `STLB`, `STLH`, `STLEX`, `STLEXB`,
`STLEXH`, `STLEXD`. The A32 (ARM-mode) decoder already had all of them, and T32 had only
`LDA` and `STL`.

- **Semantics.** `LDA*`/`STL*` are plain loads/stores; `LDAEX*`/`STLEX*` behave like
  `LDREX*`/`STREX*`.
- **Encodings.** Taken from the NDK r29 assembler (`clang --target=armv8a`, then
  `llvm-objdump --triple=thumbv8a`), for example `ldab r1,[r3]` = `e8d3 1f8f`,
  `ldaexh r1,[r3]` = `e8d3 1fdf`, `stlexd r4,r1,r2,[r3]` = `e8c3 12f4`.
2. `CRC32{B,H,W}` and `CRC32C{B,H,W}` (`FAC n F d 10zz m` / `FAD n F d 10zz m`), reusing the
   A32 `CRC32Variant`. scudo in the GSI libc computes chunk checksums with `crc32cw`
   unconditionally, so every `malloc` needs it.

3. **Precise memory aborts in A32 on arm64.** `A32AddressSpace::GenerateIR` now skips
   `A32GetSetElimination` when `check_halt_on_memory_access` is set, as
   `A64AddressSpace` already did. Without it, a halted block leaves guest registers
   written by earlier instructions of the block uncommitted.

- **Why the family is needed.** The GSI's arm32 bionic is built for armv8-a and uses these
  instructions heavily (the linker alone has ~1000 of them).
  `__libc_arc4random_ready()` (LDAB) and `pthread_mutex_lock()` (LDAEXH) run during
  linker startup, so without this patch every dynamic guest dies with an undefined
  instruction.

Other ARMv8 instructions found in the sysroot and their Dynarmic status:
- VFPv8 (`VSEL`, `VRINT*`, `VCVT{A,N,P,M}`, `VMAXNM`/`VMINNM`) and AES/SHA256: supported.
- SHA1 is decoded as UNDEFINED; it is only used when `AT_HWCAP2` advertises it, and zbrun
  reports `AT_HWCAP2 = 0`.
- T32 `HLT` is missing; it appears only on fatal-error paths.

### dynarmic-0002-asimd-narrowing.patch

Implements the four Advanced SIMD "add/subtract returning high half" instructions the A32
decoder listed but had commented out: `VADDHN`, `VRADDHN`, `VSUBHN`, `VRSUBHN`.

Each reads two 128-bit sources of 2N-bit elements and writes a 64-bit result of N-bit
elements, where the result element is bits `<2N-1:N>` of the 2N-bit sum or difference; the
rounding variants add `1 << (N-1)` to that 2N-bit value first. `HighNarrowingOperation` in
`asimd_three_regs.cpp` builds this from `VectorAdd`/`VectorSub`, an optional broadcast
round constant, `VectorLogicalShiftRight` and `VectorNarrow`, the same way the A64 frontend
implements `ADDHN`/`RADDHN`/`SUBHN`/`RSUBHN`.

Flutter's Skia premultiplies decoded PNG alpha with `vraddhn.i16`, so without this patch
image decoding dies with an undefined instruction. `guest/tests/asimd_narrow_static.c`
covers all four at every element size, including the rounding boundary, the carry out of
the 2N-bit sum and a borrow.

The remaining commented-out A32 ASIMD entries are `VQRSHL`, `VQDMLAL`, `VQDMULL` and
`VQDMLAL_scalar`.
