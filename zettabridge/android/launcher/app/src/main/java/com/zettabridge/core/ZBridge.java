 * <ol>
 *   <li>Import: {@link #fixGuestLibrary} on every extracted arm32 library before the import is
 *       marked complete.</li>
 *   <li>Launch, before plugin code runs (before the plugin Application is created):
 *       {@link #activatePlugin} with the plugin root, its targetSdk and its class loader.</li>
 *   <li>Plugin code calls System.loadLibrary; the plugin class loader returns
 *       filesDir/plugins/&lt;pkg&gt;/proxy/lib&lt;name&gt;.so, and that proxy's JNI_OnLoad calls
 *       {@link #onProxyLoaded}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Runtime layout (fixed): filesDir/zb/sysroot/system/..., filesDir/zb/guest/zbhost,
 * filesDir/zb/guest/lib/{libzbcompat.so,libzbjni.so,...}, filesDir/plugins/&lt;pkg&gt;/lib/lib&lt;name&gt;.so.
 *
 * <p>Failures are final for the process. ART replaces the UnsatisfiedLinkError thrown here by a
 * generic "JNI_ERR returned from JNI_OnLoad" and never calls JNI_OnLoad again for the same path;
 * the guest runtime is started once and never restarted; only one plugin can be active. Show
 * {@link #lastLoadError} (or {@link #loadError}) on screen, and restart the :guest process before
 * retrying or switching plugins.
